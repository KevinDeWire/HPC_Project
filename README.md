# High Performance Computing Project
Comparison of the time it takes to transform, translation and rotation, of a protein to align its first helix with another proteins helix.
The comparison will first be done with trigonomic transformation with the CPU and the GPU.
Then the comparison will be done with matrix transformation with the CPU and the GPU.
